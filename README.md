# Creating-and-Minting-an-NFT-on-Near-Blockchain
Demonstration of Creating and Minting an NFT on Near Blockchain

# Statement of Purpose
In this Near Demo Project, we are creating a testnet wallet account on Near Blockchain for creating and minting an NFT using a NFT minting Smart Contract written using Rust Programming Language. 

In this project, 

  --> I am demonstrating how to create a testnet wallet account on Near Blockchain.
  
  --> I am demonstrating how to create an account on https://demo.uniqart.io/ for creating or purchasing an NFT using 200 Near tokens which we receive when we create a testnet account.
  
  --> I am demonstrating how to mint the NFT which you created or purchased on Near Blockchain with the help of NFT Minting Smart Contract.

# What does it mean to Minting an NFT on Near Blockchain?

To mint an NFT a Smart Contract needs to able to:

  --> Keeping track of Tokens.
  
  --> Storing information for each Token (i.e, NFT metadata).
  
  --> Linking a Token with an Onwer (In this the owner is neardemoproject.testnet).

Near Wallet in testnet created with account name : neardemoproject.testnet

# Connecting your testnet account which you created on https://demo.uniqart.io/

This is an NFT Market place where you can create and purchase NFTs of your wish using 200 Near tokens which you received in the testnet account which you created previously.

Purchase an NFT of your wish from https://demo.uniqart.io/ by connecting your testnet wallet account.

Go through the link for checking the ownership of an NFT you purchased using your testnet account.

# The Tools you need to implement

  --> Yarn (Package Manager)
  
  --> Near-api-js (JavaScript library that utilizes the RPC to interact with NEAR Blockchain)
  
  --> Near-cli (cli tool that acts as a wrapper around near-api-js to interact with the NEAR Blockchain).
  
  --> NEAR testnet wallet account (using wallet.testnet.org)
  
  --> IDE such as Visual Studio Code.
